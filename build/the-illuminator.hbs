    <p>
      The Illuminator is an art-activist collective composed of visual artists,
      educators, and technologists based in New York City.
      <br />
      <br />
      The collective has staged hundreds of projection-interventions in public
      spaces, transforming the street from a space of passive consumption and
      transit into a site of engagement, conflict, and dialogue. Our work calls
      attention to the many urgent crises that confront us, in support of the
      ongoing struggle for a more just, peaceful and sustainable world.
      <br />
      <br />
      Rachel has been a member of the horizontally-structured, worker-owned coop
      since 2014, and has presented the collective's work and taught our
      guerrilla projection tactics at various conferences including Open
      Engagement, the Allied Media Conference and the Hemispheric Institute for
      Performance and Politics' Encuentros.
