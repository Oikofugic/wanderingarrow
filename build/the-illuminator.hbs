<div id="about">

    <p>
      Rachel was a member of The Illuminator, and artist-activist projection collective, from 2014 through 2023.
      <br />
      <br />
      The collective has staged hundreds of projection-interventions in public
      spaces, transforming the street from a space of passive consumption and
      transit into a site of engagement, conflict, and dialogue. Our work calls
      attention to the many urgent crises that confront us, in support of the
      ongoing struggle for a more just, peaceful and sustainable world. In her near decade with the collective, Rachel was part of over 100 projection actions.
      <br />
      <br />
      Rachel presented the collective's work and taught
      guerrilla projection tactics at various conferences including Open
      Engagement, the Allied Media Conference and the Hemispheric Institute for
      Performance and Politics' Encuentros. She also served as Financial and Operations Administrator for many years.
