        Superorganism
      </h2>
      <p class="wrap"> 
        Superorganism is a dual channel interactive video installation which proposes that digital technologies are separating us from our physical experience, which is a key component to evolving our collective consciousness. In order to address this idea, viewers' movements within the installation space manipulate the projected video, encouraging them to be physically aware and active. Superorganism seeks connections between intention and reality, suggesting that through greater awareness and cooperation, we can build a better world.

        Unsolicited
      </h2>
      <p class="wrap"> 
        Unsolicited is an interactive installation that addresses the ideas of space and power as they specifically relate to the right of passage and security of women in public spaces. By using participantsâ€™ photos without their consent, it pushes viewers to reflect on the fact that gender-based street harassment is always unsolicited. Furthermore, their movements inside the space trigger various audio and visual elements, forcing their participation in the artwork. The projected video, uniquely generated for each viewer, is an abstract visualization of their psychological and physiological reaction to the unsolicited experience, drawing attention to the invisible effects of street harassment. Unsolicited is a collaboration between Rachel Brown and Noa Ginzburg.
