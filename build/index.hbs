      Rachel is an educator, interdisciplinary media artist and community
      activist. She has taught in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from
      informal learning environments with middle and high school students to
      graduate level courses at NYU. Rachelâ€™s artistic practice stems from a
      deep aversion to inequity, a curiosity about human culture, and a desire
      to build a more just society. Rachel has screened, exhibited, and spoke
      about her creative work internationally. From 2014 to 2023, she was a core
      member of <a href="http://theilluminator.org/" target="blank" >The Illuminator</a>, a political projection collective based in NYC.
      Currently, Rachel is involved in the <a href="https://wqclt.org" target="blank" >Western Queens Community Land Trust</a>,
