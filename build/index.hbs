      Rachel is an educator, interdisciplinary media artist and community
      activist. She has taught in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from
      informal learning environments with middle and high school students to
      graduate level courses at NYU. Rachel’s artistic practice stems from a
      deep aversion to inequity, a curiosity about human culture, and a desire
      to build a more just society. Rachel has screened, exhibited, and spoke
      about her creative work internationally. Since 2014, she has been a core
      member of The Illuminator, a political projection collective based in NYC.
      She’s also currently involved in the Western Queens Community Land Trust,
      the Queens Action Council, Un Colectivo Recuerda, Resistance is Fertile
      and the Roominator Collective. Rachel has an MFA in Integrated Media Arts
      from Hunter College (CUNY), and is an avid cyclist, yogi and wanderer.
