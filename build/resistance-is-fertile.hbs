    <h1> Resistance is Fertile: the story of the 45th Street Green Space </h1>
 <p>
    is a documentary film that follows the resistance, solutions and transitions of the 45th Street Green Space, 
    a volunteer-run compost and garden project on private land in Sunnyside, Queens. 
    This film celebrates what the community has achieved since 2020, and follows their transition 
    into their final year on the lot. As they reflect on their mission and values, and evaluate how they solved problems 
    that other community gardens and the city have not solved — like controlling the rat population — 
    the storyline follows the arc of how the community members carry their learnings forward.
