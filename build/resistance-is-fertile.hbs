    <h1> Resistance is Fertile: the story of the 45th Street Green Space </h1>
 <p>
    is a documentary film that shows the social and environmental impact of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/resistance_is_fertile/" target="blank" >45th Street Green Space</a>, 
     a volunteer-run compost and garden project on private land in Sunnyside, Queens. 
     During the 2020 pandemic, a community came together to take collective responsibility for the waste they generate 
     by cutting the locks on a vacant lot and setting up a composting site. 
     Five years on, the private landlord has plans to build. This film follows the development of the project, 
     obstacles they face and actions they take in the face of interpersonal conflict, late stage capitalism, and the climate crisis.
